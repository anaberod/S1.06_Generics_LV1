🧪 S1.06 - Java Generics (Level 1)

📄 Description - Exercise Instructions

This repository contains the resolution of Level 1 Java Generics exercises.

Exercise 1
Create a class called `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type. Implement methods to store and retrieve these objects, and a constructor to initialize all three.
Verify that the arguments can be placed in any order in the constructor call.

Exercise 2
Create a class called `Person` with the attributes: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`.
Then, create a class called `GenericMethods` with a **generic method** that accepts three parameters of any type.
This method should simply print the received arguments.

In the `main()` method of the main class, call the generic method with different parameter types.
Example: a `Person` object, a `String`, and a primitive type (like `int`).

These exercises demonstrate that the method can receive arguments of any type and in any order.
